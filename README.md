#### Assignment No:5
##### Description

Used CURL to implement the following:

For each company web site, created a php web app/link that shows a list of users from company.

Assume we have a group of 3 (Company A, Company B and Company C). Thus, we have
list_of_users_A that is stored in a database A in Company A host system
list_of_users_B that is stored in a database B in Company B host system
list_of_users_C that is stored in a database C in Company C host system

Each company web site has a web link that shows list_of_users from all companies. You can access your local list_of_user via normal php database call, but you need to access remote company's database via CURL calls.
